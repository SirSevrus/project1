**PROJECT 1** 

**AIM –** To help students to manage their stuff like syllabus, notes, date sheets.

**REQUIREMENTS -**  
1. Python 3.11 or above.
1. Operating System – Windows or Linux Based.

**DESCRIPTION-** The basic idea behind making the project is to understand many great things in python programming which are helpful in developing larger and complex applications. Like the code must be to the point, create less errors, well structured, commented and time efficient code. My main motive is to help myself sharpen my skills. On the other hand, it will create a better application for students who are looking for a way to manage their academic things.

My second thing is about **How to make an application with each feature you want,** the way is a bit easier than it looks, you just write a script and just plan which feature is just needed for other ones and add it first and then add one by one but managing them to work together and to the purpose is a skill dependent on you. Don’t ignore your mistakes, instead of it see where you lack and fix it. Each mistake is a teaching.

I just written the description in an informal way, because people like informal as familiar than formal so please tell me any point where I must refine my writing skills. Thanks for giving time to my words. Have a Happy Coding. 

**PYTHON LIBRARIES** 

The python libraries which can be installed manually by user are listed below- 



|**SNo** |**LIBRARY NAME** |
| - | - |
|**1** |Tkinter |
|||

These are dependencies which are necessary to run our code. 
**HOW TO INSTALL LIBRARIES** 
You can install the libraries either by using the **pip package manager** or using **apt package manager (found on Linux).**  

- **USING PIP PACKAGE MANAGER**

  PIP Package Manager generally comes included with python. For windows hosts, PIP Package Manager is the best choice for installing the python libraries.

- **USING APT PACKAGE MANAGER**
